With 3 years of experience in Unity development using C#, I specialize in Gameplay, Physics and UI Programming. My skills have been applied to various projects, from action-packed 3D multiplayer shooters to educational games that foster children's learning experiences.

Throughout my own projects, I've experienced the full game development lifecycle, enhancing my understanding of each stage. When working with larger teams, my focus on clean code and rapid problem resolution ensures projects stay on track, minimizing delays and maintaining momentum.

I'm committed to continuous learning and regularly engage with game development podcasts, tutorials, and dev logs. This proactive approach keeps me updated with the latest industry trends, tools, and techniques.

I bring adaptability, quick integration into new teams, and an ability to deliver quality under tight deadlines. If you're seeking a dedicated game developer to bring your vision to life, I'm eager to discuss how my skills can meet your needs.
